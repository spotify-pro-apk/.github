## Introduction

Spotify is a popular music streaming service worldwide, founded in 2006 in Stockholm, Sweden. This music service provides users with access to a music library that includes over one hundred million songs and over 5 million podcasts across different genres.

This service has some key highlights such as: Free music listening & upgrade to Premium for more benefits, rich music library, highly personalized, social connectivity and ability to operate on all platforms.

When using Spotify, no matter what genre of music you like, international or personal, relaxing, or noisy, you can always find something to listen to. The music library on Spotify has a long-standing foundation and is constantly updated. Currently, it can be said that in terms of music quantity, Spotify has risen to the top 1 of the most trusted music listening applications.

With Spotify, you just type a song name or keyword into the search box and let Spotify’s algorithm do its magic. You’ll instantly get relevant search results. The more you search, the better Spotify “empathizes.” Over time, the app will get a better understanding of your music taste and deliver what you want. Spotify’s search function is also one of its key advantages over its competitors, as it’s incredibly fast and accurate.

In addition to finding songs you already know by name and melody, you can also discover new music based on your personal preferences through features like Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and playlists shared by your friends.

Not staying out of the artificial intelligence race, DJ AI is the latest feature introduced by Spotify in 2023. In addition to searching for music yourself, you now have a virtual assistant working tirelessly to help you choose songs that suit your taste.

When you like any song, whether it’s in search results, trending, or suggested playlists, you can save it by adding it to your favorites or personal playlist. This makes it easier to manage and listen to music according to your mood. You can also pin any playlist, album, or podcast to the top of the list, for quick access to the content you’re most interested in.
